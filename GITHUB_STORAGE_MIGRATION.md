## 🔧 How It Works

### File Organization
```
GitHub Repository: amhsj-files
│
├── Release: storage-amhsj-manuscripts
│   ├── 1704123456789-abc123.pdf (2.3 MB)
│   ├── 1704123457890-def456.pdf (1.8 MB)
│   └── 1704123458901-ghi789.pdf (3.1 MB)
│
├── Release: storage-amhsj-supplementary
│   ├── 1704123459012-jkl012.zip (15 MB)
│   └── 1704123460123-mno345.csv (500 KB)
│
├── Release: storage-amhsj-images
│   └── 1704123461234-pqr678.jpg (1.2 MB)
│
└── Release: storage-amhsj-profiles
    └── 1704123462345-stu901.png (800 KB)
```

### Download URLs
Files get permanent public URLs like:
```
https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/download/storage-amhsj-manuscripts/1704123456789-abc123.pdf
```

---

## 📋 Setup Required (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository
2. Name it: `amhsj-files` (or any name)
3. Make it Private (recommended) or Public
4. Initialize with README

### Step 2: Generate GitHub Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings
2. Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
3. Generate new token with `repo` scope
4. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Edit `backend/.env`:
```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_actual_token_here
GITHUB_OWNER=your-github-username
GITHUB_REPO=amhsj-files
```

### Step 4: Restart Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Look for:
```
[GitHubStorageService] GitHub storage configured successfully
```

✅ **Done! You have FREE unlimited storage!**

```

### Response Format (Same)
```json
{
  "publicId": "123456789",
  "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/download/...",
  "secureUrl": "https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/download/...",
  "format": "pdf",
  "bytes": 123456,
  "originalName": "article.pdf",
  "mimeType": "application/pdf",
  "downloadUrl": "https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/download/..."
}
```

### Delete Endpoint
```bash
DELETE /api/v1/upload/:publicId
```

Everything works the same, but now it's **FREE**! 🎉

  -F "file=@test.pdf"
```

### Verify on GitHub
1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Releases" tab
3. See your file in `storage-amhsj-manuscripts`
4. Download it to verify

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "GitHub storage not configured"
- Check all 3 env variables are set
