# ✅ Migration to AWS S3 Complete

## Summary

Your AMHSJ backend has been successfully migrated from **Cloudinary** to **AWS S3** for file storage.

---

## 🎉 What Changed

### Backend Files Modified

1. **New Service Created**
   - `src/upload/services/s3.service.ts` - Complete S3 integration with:
     - File upload with unique key generation
     - File deletion
     - Presigned URL generation (secure access)
     - File metadata retrieval
     - Multiple file operations

2. **Updated Services**
   - `src/upload/upload.service.ts` - Now uses S3Service instead of CloudinaryService
   - All file operations (upload, delete, signed URLs) now use S3

3. **Updated Module**
   - `src/upload/upload.module.ts` - Provides S3Service instead of CloudinaryService

4. **Dependencies Added**
   - `@aws-sdk/client-s3` (v3.899.0) - AWS S3 client
   - `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` (v3.899.0) - Presigned URL generation

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - `.env` - Added AWS S3 credentials template
   - `.env.example` - Created with all required variables

## 🔑 Key Features

### ✅ Raw File Access
- Files are stored exactly as uploaded (no transformations)
- Perfect for PDFs, Word documents, ZIP files, etc.

### ✅ Presigned URLs
- Secure, time-limited access to private files
- Default expiration: 7 days for downloads
- Can be regenerated at any time

### ✅ Backward Compatible
- Uses same `UploadResult` interface
- No changes needed to Article schema or frontend
- S3 key stored as `publicId` for compatibility

### ✅ Organized Structure
Files are organized by type:
```
s3://your-bucket/
  └── amhsj/
      ├── manuscripts/
      ├── supplementary/
      ├── images/
      ├── profiles/
      ├── covers/
      └── news/
```

## 📋 Next Steps - REQUIRED

### 1. Set Up AWS S3 Bucket

Follow the comprehensive guide: **`AWS_S3_SETUP.md`**

Quick checklist:
- [ ] Create AWS account (if you don't have one)
- [ ] Create S3 bucket with unique name
- [ ] Create IAM user with programmatic access
- [ ] Grant S3 permissions to IAM user
- [ ] Copy Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Edit your `.env` file and replace these placeholders:

```env
AWS_REGION=us-east-1                          # Your bucket region
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name-here          # Your bucket name
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id-here    # From IAM user
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key-here   # From IAM user
```

### 3. Restart Backend

```bash
cd backend
pnpm install  # Install new AWS SDK packages (already done)
npm start     # Or npm run dev
```

Look for this log message:
```
[S3Service] AWS S3 configured successfully
```

### 4. Test File Upload

Upload a test file through your application or use curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/upload/manuscript \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test.pdf"
```

Expected response includes:
- `publicId`: S3 key (e.g., `amhsj/manuscripts/1234567890-abc.pdf`)
- `url`: Direct S3 URL
- `downloadUrl`: Presigned URL for secure access

### 5. Test File Download

Open the `downloadUrl` from the upload response in your browser. You should get the **raw, unmodified file** (e.g., original PDF with no transformations).

## 🔄 Existing Files in Cloudinary

Your existing files in Cloudinary are **NOT automatically migrated**. You have options:

### Option A: Keep Both (Recommended Initially)
- New uploads go to S3
- Old files remain in Cloudinary
- System works with both
- Migrate gradually over time

### Option B: Manual Migration
1. Download files from Cloudinary
2. Re-upload through your admin interface
3. Update database records with new S3 keys

### Option C: Automated Migration Script
If you need help creating a script to migrate existing files, let me know!

## 🛠️ API Changes (None!)

The API remains **exactly the same** - no changes needed to your frontend:

- `POST /api/v1/upload/manuscript` - Still works
- `POST /api/v1/upload/supplementary` - Still works
- `DELETE /api/v1/upload/:publicId` - Still works (publicId is now S3 key)
- Response format unchanged

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "S3 client not initialized"
**Solution**: Check that all 4 AWS environment variables are set in `.env`

### "Access Denied" errors
**Solution**: Verify IAM user has S3 permissions (PutObject, GetObject, DeleteObject)

### Files not uploading
**Solution**: Check backend logs for detailed error messages

### Presigned URLs not working
**Solution**: 
- Verify bucket region matches `AWS_REGION` in `.env`
- Check IAM user has `GetObject` permission
- URLs expire after 7 days - regenerate if needed
